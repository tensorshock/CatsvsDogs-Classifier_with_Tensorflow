# CatsvsDogs-Classifier_with_Tensorflow
An Image Classfication project for classifying cats and dogs

The Image dataset was downloaded from microsoft's cats vs dogs page : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765

## Dataset Notebook
I always prefer to use google colab. But, Uploading the images to colab or drive was such a headache. So, I converted the Image dataset into numpy arrays and stored it into a .npy file 
and uploaded those files to google colab and used it.

## TF2- CNN's Notebook
The dataset was used in this notebook as .npy files and image classification is done.

## catsvsdogs1.h5
the model has been saved in the form of .h5 file so that it can be used again.

# Thank You
